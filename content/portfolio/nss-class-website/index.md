**Purpose:** Create a class website for NSS cohort 12 to showcase school work to potential employers before Demo Day.

**My Contributions:** Initial repo and site setup, helped construct individual modals, group photo swap behavior, and overall project organization.

**Description:** I was team lead on the creation of our class website. I coordinated the project's parts to ensure each part was completed and merged with the whole project successfully and saw the project through from vision to completed product.
