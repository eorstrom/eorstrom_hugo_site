Junior Developer Toolbox was a podcast about building, maintaining, and surviving a career in software engineering. We provided real talk from the trenches about everyday life as a junior developer.

The podcast was co-hosted by my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveharned/" target="_blank">Dave Harned</a> and myself, and early on by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-belcher-023798bb/" target="_blank">Jason Belcher</a>. We produced 40 episodes over 18 months on a biweekly basis on various topics related to software development and our experience working in the industry as junior software developers.

Our goal was to help others interested in learning more about software development and provide them resources that helped us along our journey to help them with theirs.
